  Abstract = {Spatial point processes may be analysed at two levels. Quadrat and distance methods were designed for the sampling of a population in the field. In this paper we consider those situations in which a map of a spatial pattern has been produced at some cost and we wish to extract the maximum possible information. We review the stochastic models which have been proposed for spatial point patterns and discuss methods by which the fit of such a model can be tested. Certain models are shown to be the equilibrium distributions of spatial-temporal stochastic processes. The theory is illustrated by several case studies.}

  abstract = {Several approximate permutation tests have been proposed for tests of partial regression coefficients in a linear model based on sample partial correlations. This paper begins with an explanation and notation for an exact test. It then compares the distributions of the test statistics under the various permutation methods proposed, and shows that the partial correlations under permutation are asymptotically jointly normal with means 0 and variances 1. The method of Freedman \& Lane (1983) is found to have asymptotic correlation 1 with the exact test, and the other methods are found to have smaller correlations with this test. Under local alternatives the critical values of all the approximate permutation tests converge to the same constant, so they all have the same asymptotic power. Simulations demonstrate these theoretical results.}
