\title{Random labeling with K_f functions}
\usage{
random_labelling(pattern, mtf_name = "m", nsim = 999L, r_min = NULL,
  r_max = NULL, r_vec = NULL, use_L = TRUE,
  edge_correction = "translate", use_theo = TRUE, method = "permute",
  use_biased_lambda2 = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pattern}{A \code{\link[spatstat]{ppp}} object as the simple marked
point pattern to be analysed. The marks need to be in the form of a
numeric vector. The window has to have the type "rectangle".}

\item{mtf_name}{A vector of mark test function names. "1" stands for the
unmarked K-function. Accepted values are '1', 'm', 'mm', 'gamma',
'gammaAbs' and 'morAbs'. See \code{\link[marksummary]{summ_func_random_labelling}}.}

\item{nsim}{The number of permutations.}

\item{r_min}{The minimum radius to include.}

\item{r_max}{A positive scalar value representing the maximum radius that
should be considered. r_vec overrides r_max in calculation of functions.
However, after calculation of functions, they are cropped to the interval
[r_min, r_max] (if max(r_vec) > r_max loss in computing time).
By default, r_max is NULL and will get a sensible default.}

\item{r_vec}{A monotonically increasing vector of non-negative r-values
to act as the endpoints of the bins for the K_f-functions. The bins are
exclusive on the left and inclusive on the right. If the first vector
element has value zero, it will be regarded as the collapsed bin [0, 0],
and the next bin will start from and exclude 0.}

\item{use_L}{A boolean describing whether the L_f function, L_f = sqrt(K_f/pi),
should be used instead of the K_f function.}

\item{edge_correction}{The name of the edge correction to be used. Options
are 'translate' and 'none'.}

\item{use_theo}{Whether to use the theoretical summary function or the
mean of the simulations.}

\item{method}{The name of the method to create simulations under the null
hypothesis. 'permute' results in permutations of the marks. Using
'sample' will sample the marks from the empirical mark distribution
with replacement. 'permute' is the default.}

\item{use_biased_lambda2}{A logical scalar on whether to use the biased
or the unbiased (in the Poisson case) estimate of the intensity
squared.}

\description{
Perform simulations under the random labelling for a marked point pattern
and estimate K_f- or L_f-functions for the pattern and simulations.
