\usage{
\method{plot}{fboxplot}(x, plot_style = c("basic", "fv", "ggplot2"),
   dotplot = length(x$r)<10, level = 1,
   outliers = TRUE, bp.col = 2, cr.col = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an 'fboxplot' object}

\item{plot_style}{One of the following "basic", "fv" or "ggplot2".
The option "basic" (default) offers a very basic global envelope plot.
The option "fv" utilizes the plot routines of the function value table \code{\link[spatstat]{fv.object}}.
For "ggplot2", a plot with a coloured envelope ribbon is provided. Requires R library ggplot2.
The option "fv" is currently only available for tests with one test function, whereas the other true allow
also tests with several tests functions.}

\item{dotplot}{Logical. If TRUE, then instead of envelopes a dot plot is done.
Suitable for low dimensional test vectors. Only applicable if \code{plot_style} is "basic".
Default: TRUE if the dimension is less than 10, FALSE otherwise.}

\item{level}{1 or 2. In the case of combined tests (with several test functions), two different plots are available:
1 for plotting the combined global envelopes (default and most often wanted) or
2 for plotting the second level test result.}

\item{outliers}{Logical. If TRUE, then the functions outside the functional boxplot are drawn.}

\item{bp.col}{The color for the boxplot bounds. Default 2 (red).}

\item{cr.col}{The color for the central region bounds.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to \code{\link{plot.global_envelope}}.}
