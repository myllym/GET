\title{Approximative normal envelope test}
\usage{
normal_envelope(curve_set, alpha = 0.05, n_norm = 2e+05, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{curve_set}{A curve_set (see \code{\link{create_curve_set}}) or an \code{\link[spatstat]{envelope}}
object. If an envelope object is given, it must contain the summary
functions from the simulated patterns which can be achieved by setting
savefuns = TRUE when calling \code{\link[spatstat]{envelope}}.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level. The 100(1-alpha)\% global envelope will be calculated.}

\item{n_norm}{Number of simulations drawn from the multivariate normal distribution (dimension = number of distances r).}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to \code{\link{estimate_p_value}} to obtain a point estimate
for the p-value. The default point estimate is the mid-rank p-value. The choice should not affect the
result, since no ties are expected to occur.}
}
\value{
An object of class "envelope_test", "envelope" and "fv" (see \code{\link[spatstat]{fv.object}}),
which can be printed and plotted directly.

Essentially a data frame containing columns
\itemize{
\item r = the vector of values of the argument r at which the test was made
\item obs = values of the test function for the data point pattern
\item lo = the lower envelope based on the simulated functions
\item hi = the upper envelope based on the simulated functions
\item central = If the curve_set (or envelope object) contains a component 'theo',
      then this function is used as the central curve and returned in this component.
      Otherwise, the central curve is the mean of the test functions T_i(r), i=2, ..., s+1.
      Used for visualization only.
}
Additionally, the return value has attributes
\itemize{
  \item method = The name of the envelope test ("Approximative normal envelope test")
  \item alternative = "two-sided
  \item p = A point estimate for the p-value (default is the mid-rank p-value).
  \item u_alpha = The value of u corresponding to the 100(1-alpha)\% global envelope.
  \item u = Deviation values (u[1] is the value for the data pattern). Returned only if savedevs = TRUE.
  \item call = The call of the function.
}
and a punch of attributes for the "fv" object type.

\description{
Approximative normal envelope test

\details{
The normal envelope test is a parametric envelope test.
If simulation from the null model is extremely tedious, for some test functions T(r)
it is possible to use a normal approximation as suggested by Mrkvicka (2009) in a study
of random closed sets.
The basis of the test is the approximation of the test function T(r), r in I=[r_min, r_max],
by a random vector (T(r_1), ...,T(r_m))', where m is the number of distances, that follows
multivariate normal distribution with mean mu and variance matrix Sigma which are estimated
from T_j(r), j=2, ...,s+1. This test employes T_j(r), j=2, ...,s+1, only for estimating mu
and Sigma, and for this s=100 simulations is enough to reach needed accuracy.

This normal envelope test is not a Monte Carlo test. It employes the same envelopes as the
studentised envelope test (see \code{\link{st_envelope}}), i.e. the semiparametric kth lower
and upper envelopes

T^u_{low}(r)= T_0(r) - u sqrt(var_0(T(r)))
and
T^u_{upp}(r)= T_0(r) + u sqrt(var_0(T(r))),

but the p-value and the 100(1-alpha) percent global envelope are calculated based
on simulations from a multivariate normal distribution.
